1. Open the Color Manager
2. Click and hold the drag handle (⋮⋮) next to any color
3. Drag the color to your desired position
4. Release to drop
5. Close the dialog

The new order will be saved automatically and appear in the highlight dropdown.

## Translation-Specific Highlighting

Highlights are **translation-specific**, meaning:

- Highlights are tied to the Bible translation you were using when you created them
- If you switch to a different translation, you won't see your highlights
- A warning icon appears if you have highlights for another translation

### Translation Mismatch Warning

When you see the warning icon on the highlight button:

1. It means you have highlights in a different translation
2. Click the button to see which translation contains your highlights
3. You can:
   - Switch back to that translation to see your highlights
   - Start creating highlights in the current translation
   - Dismiss the warning

**Why translation-specific?**
Different translations have different verse numbering and text, so highlights from one translation may not align properly with another.

## Import & Export

### Exporting Highlights

Save your highlights to back them up or share them:

1. Go to Settings → **Highlights**
2. Click **Export**
3. A file named `jota-app-highlights.json` will be downloaded

## Tips & Best Practices

### Organizing Your Study

**Create a color scheme:**
- Assign specific meanings to each color
- Use consistent colors across your study
- Example: Red for warnings, Green for promises, Blue for commands

**Use descriptive names:**
- Rename colors to match your study style
- "Prayer Requests" is clearer than "Color 1"
- "Jesus' Words" is more meaningful than "Red"

**Highlight ranges:**
- You can highlight single verses or verse ranges
- Select multiple verses for context-rich passages
- Break long passages into logical sections

### Managing Many Highlights

**Export regularly:**
- Back up your highlights weekly or monthly
- Keep exports organized by date
- Store backups in cloud storage

**Color organization:**
- Reorder colors by frequency of use
- Put your most-used colors at the top
- Group related colors together

**Stay within storage limits:**
- Check storage usage periodically
- Remove unused highlights
- Export and archive old study sessions

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Can I highlight the same verse with multiple colors?**
A: No, each verse can only have one highlight color at a time. Applying a new color will replace the previous one.

**Q: What happens to my highlights when I update the app?**
A: Your highlights are stored in your browser's local storage and persist through app updates.

**Q: Can I share my highlights with others?**
A: Yes! Export your highlights and share the JSON file. Others can import it into their app.

**Q: Why don't I see my highlights in a different translation?**
A: Highlights are translation-specific to ensure accuracy. You'll need to create new highlights in each translation.

**Q: How many highlights can I create?**
A: There's no hard limit, but you're constrained by browser storage space (typically 5-10 MB). The app will warn you if you approach the limit.

**Q: Can I use the same color palette across devices?**
A: Not automatically, but you can export your highlights (which includes colors) and import them on another device.

**Q: What if I accidentally remove a color with many highlights?**
A: There's no undo, so be careful! Always export your highlights before making major changes. The confirmation dialog shows how many highlights will be affected.

**Q: Can I customize the highlight appearance?**
A: Colors can be customized via the Color Manager. The highlighting style (background color, text visibility) is standardized for readability.

## Troubleshooting

### Highlights Not Appearing

1. Check that highlighting is enabled in Settings → General
2. Verify you're viewing the same translation where you created the highlights
3. Look for the translation mismatch warning

### Can't Add More Highlights

1. Check storage usage in Settings → Highlights
2. If storage is full, export and remove old highlights
3. Consider clearing browser cache (may remove highlights - export first!)

### Color Picker Not Working

1. Make sure you're entering valid hex color codes (#RRGGBB format)
2. Use the visual color picker instead of typing codes
3. Try refreshing the page

### Import Failed

1. Verify the file is a valid JSON export from this app
2. Check the file wasn't corrupted during transfer
3. Try exporting a fresh backup first, then importing

## Technical Notes

### Storage Format

Highlights are stored in your browser's localStorage as JSON data including:
- Passage references (book, chapter, verse range)
- Color IDs
- Timestamps
- Translation metadata

### Browser Compatibility

The highlighting feature works in all modern browsers:
- Chrome/Edge (recommended)
- Firefox
- Safari
- Opera

### Performance

- Highlighting is optimized for chapters with many highlights
- Color changes update in real-time
- No server communication needed (all local storage)
